Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies multiple diseases, including Brain Stroke, Obesity, and Depression, based on various health parameters. 
The goal is to create an early detection system that can predict the likelihood of an individual suffering from one or more of these conditions. 
By leveraging advanced classification algorithms, the model will help in proactive healthcare and assist in timely interventions.

Key Features:

Disease Classification: Predicts the risk of Brain Stroke, Obesity, and Depression based on health data.

Data-Driven Approach: Utilizes a variety of features such as age, gender, physical activity level, and other lifestyle factors.

Machine Learning Models: Implements popular classification algorithms like Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and Neural Networks for accurate disease predictions.

Comprehensive Dataset: The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing health-related information that correlates with the diseases.

Motivation:

Early diagnosis of diseases such as brain stroke, obesity, and depression can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project aims to provide a reliable tool to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in identifying potential health risks.

Technologies Used:
Python

Machine Learning: XGBoost, Random Forest, Decision Trees, Neural Networks
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
